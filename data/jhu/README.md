# Description

The dataset collects COVID-19 case numbers on a per country basis from
publicly available health databases like those managed by national or
supranational health authorities. The dataset is maintained by the
Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Content of the data:

 - Numbers on cases with reported "confirmed" (infections), "deaths"
   and "recovered". These are delivered in a separate CSV file for
   each case type. This is the "time series" data.

 - Updated on a daily basis. Delivered as a set of CSV files on
   GitHub. Each file contains data for all of the past days since the
   reporting started.

 - Granularity of the data is on a per country level, and for some
   countries on a per province basis.

 - In addition to the "time series" described above, there are "daily
   reports" files where one CVS is provided per day and reports the
   "confirmed", "deaths" and "recovered" as a cumulative amount up to
   that day per country (or province). The "time series" data is
   automatically derived from the "daily reports".
