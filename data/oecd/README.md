DATA: http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/

# Description

Only quick analysis of this dataset was done. The data is delivered as
an Excel spreadsheet where each row describes a set of policy
responses to COVID-19 in a certain country. The data itself is
human-readable. Manual processing would be needed to make the data
quantified.
