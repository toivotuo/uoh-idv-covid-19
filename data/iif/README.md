# Description

The "Institute of International Finance" (IIF) provides two datasets:

  * COVID-19 Regulatory Measures

  * COVID-19 Global Policy Response Summary

These datasets are described separately below.


## COVID-19 Regulatory Measures

This dataset has "Prudential Regulatory Measures in Response to
COVID-19". The data primarily includes regulatory changes in how
financial institutions (read: banks) are treated. Following data is
included:

  * Changes in bank capitalisation requirements

  * Changes in bank liquidity requirements

  * Changes in treatment of non-performing loans (NPL)

  * Implementation schedules (?)

  * Other matters such as relaxation of reporting requirements

The data is delivered as a PDF file where each measure is described in
human-readable format. For automated processing the data would need to
be manually converted into a quantified format. Thus for immediate
quantitative analysis it is not useful.


## COVID-19 Global Policy Response Summary

This dataset contains policy responses around the globe for each
jurisdiction. The data has three columns for different types of
responses: monetary, fiscal and macroprudential. For each, separation

is made for measures already taken and measures that are upcoming.

The data is delivered as an Excel spreadsheet. Contents is
human-readable. The data is not immediately usable in quantitative
analysis, and would need manual preprocessing.
