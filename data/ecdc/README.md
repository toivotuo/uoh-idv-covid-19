# Description

Worldwide COVID-19 cases as delivered by the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Data is very similar in scope
to the data provided by the JHU dataset, but in a format that is
easier to process. It should be noted though that the ECDC dataset
reports one row per day per country, and that's the number of cases
(and deaths) in the country on that day. Cumulative numbers are not
reported.

Whether the data content also matches in terms of COVID-19 numbers is
unknown.
