# Description

The "Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker" (OxCGRT) collects
policy responses from governments to the COVID-19 crisis. The
responses are scored based on how stringent the measures
are. Countries can thus be compared on the stringency of their
response to the crisis.

Data format is an Excel file (XLSX).

Data looks at seven variables:

  - S1: School closing
  - S2: Workplace closing
  - S3: Cancel public events
  - S4: Close public transport
  - S5: Public information campaigns
  - S6: Restrictions on internal movement
  - S7: International travel controls

The variables have 2-3 different values depending on the severity of
the measures. Also, most variables have a separate boolean describing
whether the measures are targeted (e.g. certain region) or general
(e.g. covering the whole country).
